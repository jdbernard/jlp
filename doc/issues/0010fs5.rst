Modify `org` behavior to include simple anchors.
================================================

Currently JLP supports at most one `org` directive per block which identifies the block.
It would be useful to support multiple `org` directives within a block, particularly
when there is a large block that may have many interesting internal targets. Maybe the
`org` directive should be handled differently when it is used multiple times within a
block. This would be discovered in the generator parse phase and we could change the
LinkAnchor type at that time. During the parse phase we emit the new type of anchors
as `<a id="link-name"/>` into the document. We would also change our search for block
ids to inly look for the single-occurance type of `orgs`.
