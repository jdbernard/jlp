Abstract `jlp:` link resolution.
================================

I need to think of a system to allow the resolution of `jlp:` protocol links
to be easily configured. Currently the link resolution assumes straigtforward
file-based storage and converts them into relative paths. An example of another
type of resolution strategy might be a DB-backed solution where each document
has a unique id (this is already happening temporarily in the JLP process) and
there is some schema for mapping document id's to URIs for the document. Or
perhaps another file-based solution with different convention for document storage.
