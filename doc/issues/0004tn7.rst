Fix delimited doc block behavior.
=================================

Delimited doc blocks require that the start token be the first non-space token
on the line it is on and that the end token be on it's own line. This is not in
line with the general nature of delimited comment blocks, which do not place
any restrictions on what comes before the start delimiter or after the end
delimiter.
