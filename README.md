Jonathan's Literate Programming
===============================

This project grew out of a desire for a documentation system that:

* generates all documentation from source-code comments,
* is capable of facilitating both JavaDoc-style API documentation as well as
  literate programming style of documentation,
* has pluggable formatting (default to Markdown),
